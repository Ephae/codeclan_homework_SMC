Interpret the regression coefficient of estimated_length (i.e. slope, gradient) you obtain from the model. How do you interpret the r2 value reported by the model?:

For every 4.5876 predicted days, the actual amount of days was 0.5292 more. 

```{r}
autoplot(project_management_model)

## Residuals vs Fitted  

Drops far away from 0 - doesn't seem reliable

## Normal Q-Q  
Normally distributed

## Scale-Location  
seems reliable

# Extension
## Residuals vs Leverage
Unsure of meaning
